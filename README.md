# Testing

## A collection of random tiny projects I've written over the years to test things out

This repo contains all the random small projects I've written over the years (I believe I started this at 15-16) for running quick and dirty tests in a less clutered environment. None of the projects in this repo are guaranteed to work, and I realistically won't maintain any of them. This is simply proof that I've been working on things for a while now
