# LCS - Longest common subsequence
#
# Given 2 sequences, A and B, find the longest common subsequence between them
#
# Sequence - An array of integers (or really any value)
# Subsequence - A new sequence created by deleting 0 or more elements of an array
# Common subsequence - A subsequence shared between 2 or more sequences
#
# Examples:
# A = [1 2 3 4 5]
# B = [2 3 4 5 6]
# [2 3 4 5] is the longest common subsequence
#
# C = [2 3 1 5 6]
# D = [1 2 3 4 5]
# [1], [2], [3] and [5] are the longest common subsequences
