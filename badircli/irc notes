When a client is connected to a server, streams of bytes are sent to each other, seperated by '\r' and 
'\n' characters. These characters should use UTF-8 encoding. 

An IRC message is a single line delimited by a pair of CR ('\r') and LF ('\n') characters. That means
each message ends with: "\r\n"

A message should be formatted as such:
    ['@' <tags> SPACE] [':' <source> SPACE] <command> <parameters> <crlf>
